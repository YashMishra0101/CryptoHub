At CryptoHub, a comprehensive cryptocurrency monitoring platform, I am developing a project where users can view the top 12 cryptocurrencies on the homepage and access global cryptocurrency statistics. Additionally, there's a dedicated section for Cryptocurrencies where users can explore the top 50 cryptocurrencies and bookmark them. Furthermore, there's a dedicated news section where users can read top news about cryptocurrencies worldwide. We've added a smart chat feature to CryptoHub, powered by the Google Gemini AI model. It's like having a helpful assistant always available to guide users through the website. Users can ask anything, not just about cryptocurrencies, and get real-time responses. Additionally, there's an About page providing information about our website. For the frontend, we're utilizing HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and React.js. Firebase serves as the backend, and we're using two APIs from RapidAPI. For cryptocurrencies, we're using the CoinRanking API, and for news, we're using the Cryptocurrencies News API. With the help of our website, users can monitor top cryptocurrencies, making it a comprehensive monitoring platform. Moreover, CryptoHub consists of 8 pages: Home, Cryptocurrencies, News, Login, Signup, Logout, About, and Bookmark. These pages cater to different user needs and ensure a seamless browsingÂ experience."
